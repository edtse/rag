## Credits
All credits go to [this repository](https://github.com/pixegami/rag-tutorial-v2/tree/main). I am only forking it to fit my needs.

## Changes from the Main Project
- Use LLaMA3
- Search for `.md`, `.pdf`, and `.docx` files recursively (Note: This is for word processing purposes)
- Delete entries from the database for files that have been updated or removed

**Note**: This project will not be maintained.
